# Updating ResX Manager Configuration

After installing ResX Manager, you may want to configure certain settings to streamline your workflow. Specifically, you might want to ensure that the "File creation" option is checked and the "Confirm adding new resource files" option is unchecked. This allows ResX Manager to automatically create necessary files without prompting you for confirmation each time, which can be rechecked later once all initial files are created.

## Step 1: Open ResX Manager
- Open your project in Visual Studio.
- Go to `Tools -> ResX Manager` to open the ResX Manager window.

## Step 2: Access ResX Manager Options
- In the ResX Manager window, locate the Options button. This is typically represented by a gear icon or found under a menu within the ResX Manager interface.
- Click on the Options button to open the configuration settings.

## Step 3: Modify File Creation Settings
- In the configuration settings, find the `File creation` option.
- Ensure that the `File creation` option is checked. This setting allows ResX Manager to create resource files automatically when needed.

## Step 4: Modify Confirmation Settings
- Locate the `Confirm adding new resource files` option within the same settings window.
- Ensure that the `Confirm adding new resource files` option is unchecked. This will prevent ResX Manager from prompting you for confirmation each time a new resource file needs to be added.

## Step 5: Apply and Save Settings
- After making these changes, click `Apply` or `OK` to save the settings.
- Close the configuration settings window.

## Step 6: Recheck Confirmation Setting After Initial Creation
- Once all the necessary resource files have been initially created, you may want to re-enable the confirmation setting to avoid accidental file creation in the future.
- Repeat steps 1 and 2 to access the ResX Manager options.
- Check the `Confirm adding new resource files` option again.

This setup will streamline your initial workflow by automatically handling file creation and allow you to maintain control over resource file management once the initial setup is complete.
