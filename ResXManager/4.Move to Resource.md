# Updating ResX Manager Configuration for "Move to Resource"

To extend the patterns for .cs files and add new patterns for .razor files in the "Move to Resource" section of ResX Manager, follow these steps:

## Step 1: Open ResX Manager
- Open your project in Visual Studio.
- Go to `Tools -> ResX Manager` to open the ResX Manager window.

## Step 2: Access ResX Manager Options
- In the ResX Manager window, locate the Options button. This is typically represented by a gear icon or found under a menu within the ResX Manager interface.
- Click on the Options button to open the configuration settings.

## Step 3: Modify Patterns for .cs Files
- In the configuration settings, find the section related to `Move to Resource` patterns.
- Locate the patterns for .cs files. It may be under a specific tab or section labeled Patterns or File Patterns.
- Extend the existing pattern for .cs files by adding the following:

|Localizer["$Key"]|SharedLocalizer["$Key"]

Ensure that the `|` character is used as the separator.

## Step 4: Add New Pattern for .razor Files
- In the same `Move to Resource` patterns section, add a new pattern for .razor files.
- Specify the file extension `.razor`.
- Add the pattern:

@Localizer["$Key"]|@SharedLocalizer["$Key"]

Again, ensure that the `|` character is used as the separator.
